What O
is O
Nmap B-TOOL

Nmap B-TOOL
is O
a O
network B-TECHNIQUE
scanning I-TECHNIQUE
tool B-TOOL
that O
uses O
IP B-DATA
packets I-DATA
to O
identify O
all O
the O
devices B-SYSTEM
connected O
to O
a O
network B-SYSTEM
and O
provide O
information B-DATA
on O
the O
services B-APP
and O
operating B-SYSTEM
systems I-SYSTEM
they O
are O
running O

The O
program O
is O
most O
commonly O
used O
via O
a O
command-line B-TOOL
interface I-TOOL
though O
GUI B-TOOL
front-ends I-TOOL
are O
also O
available O

It O
is O
available O
for O
many O
different O
operating B-SYSTEM
systems I-SYSTEM
such O
as O
Linux B-SYSTEM
Free B-SYSTEM
BSD I-SYSTEM
and O
Gentoo B-SYSTEM

Nmap B-TOOL
was O
developed O
for O
enterprise-scale B-SYSTEM
networks I-SYSTEM
and O
can O
scan B-FUNCTION
through O
thousands O
of O
connected B-SYSTEM
devices I-SYSTEM

Moreover O
Nmap B-TOOL
has O
been O
increasingly O
used O
to O
inspect O
IoT B-TECHNIQUE
security I-TECHNIQUE

Nmap B-TOOL
provides O
information B-DATA
on O
every O
active B-FEATURE
IP B-FEATURE
so O
you O
can O
determine O
if O
an O
IP B-FEATURE
is O
being O
used O
by O
a O
legitimate B-FEATURE
service B-APP
or O
an O
external B-ATTACKER
attacker I-ATTACKER

Your O
network B-SYSTEM
as O
a O
whole O

hosts I-SYSTEM
open B-FEATURE
ports I-FEATURE
and O
the O
OS B-SYSTEM
of O
every O

Vulnerabilities B-VULNERABILITY
scan B-FUNCTION
your O
own O

to O
simulate O
the O
process B-TECHNIQUE
that O
a O
hacker B-ATTACKER
would O
use O
to O
attack B-ATTACK
your O
site B-SYSTEM

The O
primary O
uses O
of O
Nmap B-TOOL
can O
be O
broken O
into O
three O
core O
processes B-TECHNIQUE

First O
the O
program O
gives O
you O
detailed O
information B-DATA
on O
every O
IP B-FEATURE
active B-FEATURE
on O
your O
networks B-SYSTEM
and O
each O
IP B-FEATURE
can O
then O
be O
scanned B-FUNCTION

This O
allows O
administrators B-SECURITYTEAM
to O
check O
whether O
an O
IP B-FEATURE
is O
being O
used O
by O
a O
legitimate B-FEATURE
service I-FEATURE
or O
an O
external B-ATTACKER
attacker I-ATTACKER

Secondly O
Nmap B-TOOL
provides O
information B-DATA
on O
your O
network B-SYSTEM
as O
a O
whole O

It O
can O
be O
used O
to O
provide O
a O
list O
of O
live B-SYSTEM
hosts I-SYSTEM
and O
open B-FEATURE
ports I-FEATURE
and O
identify O
the O
OS B-SYSTEM
of O
every O
connected B-SYSTEM
device I-SYSTEM

This O
makes O
it O
a O
valuable O
tool B-TOOL
in O
ongoing O
system B-TECHNIQUE
monitoring I-TECHNIQUE
and O
a O
critical O
part O
of O
pentesting B-TECHNIQUE

Nmap B-TOOL
can O
be O
used O
alongside O
the O
Metasploit B-TOOL
framework I-TOOL
for O
instance O
to O
probe B-TECHNIQUE
and O
then O
repair O
network B-VULNERABILITY
vulnerabilities I-VULNERABILITY

Thirdly O
Nmap B-TOOL
has O
also O
become O
a O
valuable O
tool B-TOOL
for O
users B-USER
looking O
to O
protect O
personal B-SYSTEM
and O
business B-SYSTEM
websites I-SYSTEM

Using O
Nmap B-TOOL
to O
scan B-TECHNIQUE
your O
own O
web B-SYSTEM
server I-SYSTEM
particularly O
if O
you O
are O
hosting B-FEATURE
your O
website B-SYSTEM
from O
home B-SYSTEM
is O
essentially O
simulating O
a O
hacker B-ATTACKER
process B-TECHNIQUE
to O
attack B-ATTACK
your O
site B-SYSTEM

Attacking B-ATTACK
your O
own O
site B-SYSTEM
in O
this O
way O
is O
a O
powerful O
way O
of O
identifying O
security B-VULNERABILITY
vulnerabilities I-VULNERABILITY

Nmap B-TOOL
is O
straightforward O
to O
use O
and O
most O
of O
the O
tools B-TOOL
it O
provides O
are O
familiar O
to O
system B-SECURITYTEAM
admins I-SECURITYTEAM
from O
other O
programs B-FUNCTION

Nmap B-TOOL
advantage O
is O
that O
it O
brings O
a O
wide O
range O
of O
these O
tools B-TOOL
into O
one O
program B-FUNCTION
rather O
than O
forcing O
you O

To O
use O
Nmap B-TOOL
you O

The O

Filtering B-FEATURE

In O
some O

This O
distinction O
allows O

The O

Nmap B-TOOL
offers O
several O
timing B-FEATURE
modes I-FEATURE
that O
can O
be O
selected O
with O
the O
T O
option O
to O
accomplish O
this O

For O
example O
the O
T O
paranoid B-FEATURE
option I-FEATURE
causes O
Nmap B-TOOL
to O
send O
just O
one O
probe B-TECHNIQUE
at O
a O
time O
waiting O
five O
minutes O
between O
them O

A O
large O
scan B-TECHNIQUE
may O
take O
weeks O
but O
at O
least O
it O
probably O
will O
not O
be O
detected B-TECHNIQUE

The O
T O
sneaky B-FEATURE
option I-FEATURE
is O
similar O
but O
it O
only O
waits O
15 O

rather O

can O
be O
a O
major O
problem O
for O

particularly O
because O
the O
handling O
of O
oddities O
such O

overlapping B-FEATURE
fragments I-FEATURE
and O
fragmentation B-FEATURE
assembly I-FEATURE
timeouts I-FEATURE
are O
ambiguous O
and O
differ O
substantially O
between O
platforms B-SYSTEM

Thus O
the O
IDS B-TOOL
often O
has O
to O
guess O
at O
how O
the O
remote B-SYSTEM
system I-SYSTEM
will O
interpret O
a O
packet B-DATA

An O
Nmap B-TOOL
scan B-TECHNIQUE
will O
use O
tiny B-FEATURE
IP I-FEATURE
fragments I-FEATURE

By O
default O
Nmap B-TOOL
will O
include O
up O
to O
eight O
bytes B-DATA
of O
data B-DATA
in O
each O

so O
a O
typical O
20 O
or O
24 O
byte B-DATA
depending O
on O
options O
TCP B-DATA
packet I-DATA
is O
sent O
in O
three O
tiny B-FEATURE

Every O

adds O
eight O
