84,Attacking your own site in this way is a powerful way of identifying security vulnerabilities,B-attack O O B-system O O O O O O O O O B-vulnerability I-vulnerability
85,Nmap is straightforward to use and most of the tools it provides are familiar to system admins from other programs,B-tool O O O O O O O O B-tool O O O O O  B-securityTeam I-securityTeam O O B-function
86,Nmap advantage is that it brings a wide range of these tools into one program rather than forcing you to skip between separate and discrete network monitoring tools,B-tool O O O O O O O O O O B-tool O O B-function O O O O O O O O O O B-technique I-technique B-tool
87, To use Nmap you need to be familiar with command-line interfaces, O O B-tool O O O O O O B-tool I-tool I-tool

89,TCP Full Connect Vanilla Scan,B-technique I-technique I-technique I-technique I-technique
90,we assume that the scanning targetâs IP address ,O O O O B-technique B-system B-feature I-feature
91,TCP Connect scan completes the 3-way handshake,B-technique I-technique I-technique O O B-technique I-technique 
92,If a port is open the operating system completed the TCP three-way handshake and the port scanner immediately closes the connection to avoid DOS ,O O B-feature O B-feature O B-system I-system O O B-feature B-technique I-technique I-technique O O B-tool I-tool O O O B-feature O O B-attack 
93,"This is ""noisy because the services can log the sender IP address and trigger Intrusion Detection Systems",O O B-feature O O B-feature O B-function O B-system B-feature I-feature O O B-tool I-tool I-tool
94,the Full scan has the following features,O B-technique I-technique O O O O

103,It may be quite slow since some machines intentionally slow down responses to this kind of traffic to avoid being overwhelmed ,O O O O O O O B-system O B-feature I-feature I-feature O O O O B-data O O O O 
104,Machines running Windows OS however do not implement this slowdown feature so you should use UDP to scan Windows hosts normally,B-system O B-system I-system O O O O O B-feature I-feature O O O O B-feature O B-technique B-system B-system  O
105,The UDP Scan sends a UDP packet to target ports to determine if a UDP service is listening,O B-technique I-technique O O B-data I-data O B-feature I-feature O O O O B-feature I-feature O B-feature
106,If the target system returns an ICMP Port Unreachable message the target port is closed Otherwise the target port is assumed to be open,O O B-system I-system O O B-data I-data I-data I-data O B-feature I-feature O B-feature O O B-feature I-feature O O O O B-feature
107,UDP scan is unreliable since there may be false positives,B-technique I-technique O O O O O O B-feature I-feature
108,The UDP scan can be very slow due to the following reasons,O B-technique I-technique O O O B-feature O O O O O
109,Open and filtered ports rarely send any response leaving Nmap to time out,B-feature O B-feature I-feature O B-function O B-feature O B-tool O B-feature I-feature
110,Closed ports usually send back an ICMP port unreachable error But many hosts rate limit ICMP port unreachable messages by default eg 1/sec,B-feature I-feature O O O O B-data I-data I-data I-data O O B-system B-technique I-technique B-data I-data I-data I-data O B-feature O O
111,To speed up the UDP scan Increase host parallelism use min-hostgroup to scan multiple hosts at once,O O O O B-technique I-technique O B-feature I-feature O B-feature I-feature O B-technique O B-system O O
112,Scan popular ports first using the -F option to scan the most common UDP ports,B-technique O B-feature O O O O O O B-technique O O O B-feature I-feature

116,Use -v verbosity and chill out Nmap provides estimated time for scan completion of each host,O O B-feature O B-feature I-feature B-tool O O O O B-technique O O O B-system
117,SYN scan is another form of TCP scanning ,B-technique I-technique O O O O B-technique I-technique 
118,Rather than using the operating systemâs network functions the port scanner generates raw IP packets and monitors for responses ,O O O O B-system I-system  B-function I-function O B-tool I-tool O B-data I-data I-data O B-technique O B-feature 
119,This scan type is also known as âhalf-open scanning because it never actually opens a full TCP connection ,O B-technique O O O O O B-technique I-technique O O O O B-feature O B-feature I-feature I-feature 
120,The port scanner generates a SYN packet ,O B-tool I-tool O O B-data I-data 
121,If the target port is open it will respond with an SYN-ACK packet,O O B-feature I-feature O B-feature O O B-feature O O B-data I-data 
122,The scanner host responds with an RST packet closing the connection before the handshake is completed,O B-tool B-system B-feature O O B-data I-data B-feature O B-feature O O B-technique O O
123,If the port is closed but unfiltered the target will instantly respond with an RST packet ,O O B-feature O B-feature O B-feature O B-system O O B-feature O O B-data I-data 
124,There is debate over which scan is less intrusive on the target host ,O O O O O B-technique O O B-attack O O B-system I-system
125,SYN scan has the advantage that the individual services never actually receive a connection,B-technique I-technique O O O O O O B-feature O O B-function O B-feature
126,Only sends the initial SYN and waits for ACK to detect open port,O O O O B-feature O O O B-feature O B-technique B-feature I-feature
127,SYN scans stop two-thirds of the way through the 3-way handshake aka half-open scan,B-technique I-technique O O O O O O O B-technique I-technique O B-technique  I-technique
128,Attacker sends a RESET RST after receiving an SYN-ACK response,B-attacker O O B-feature I-feature O B-feature O B-feature I-feature 
129,A true connection is never established thus the target may not log the connection,O O B-feature O O B-feature O O B-system O O B-function O B-feature
130,Faster and stealthier than a full TCP Connect scans,O O B-vulnerability O O B-technique I-technique I-technique I-technique
131,If the target port is closed the destination will send a RESET or nothing,O O B-feature I-feature O B-feature O B-system O O O B-feature O O
132,SYN flood may cause accidental denial-of-service attacks if the target is slow,B-attack I-attack O O B-attack B-attack I-attack O O B-system O B-feature
133,FIN scan is a stealthy scan like the SYN scan but sends a TCP FIN packet instead ,B-technique I-technique O O B-technique I-technique O O B-technique I-technique O B-function O B-data I-data I-data O
134,Most but not all computers will send an RST packet back if they get this input so that the FIN scan can show false positives and negatives but it may get under the radar of some IDS programs and other countermeasures,O O O O O O O O B-data I-data O O O O O B-feature O O O B-technique I-technique O O B-feature I-feature O B-feature O O O O O O O O O B-tool B-function O O O
135,Ack scanning determines whether the port is filtered or not ,B-technique I-technique O O O B-feature O B-feature O O 
136,This is especially good when attempting to probe for the existence of a firewall and its rulesets ,O O O O O O O B-technique O O O O O B-tool O O B-function 
137,Simple packet filtering will allow established connections packets with the ACK bit set whereas a more sophisticated stateful firewall might not,O B-technique I-technique O O B-feature I-feature B-data O O I-data I-data O O O O O B-feature B-tool O O
138,ACK scan Sends a packet with the ACK code bit set to each target port,B-technique I-technique O O B-data O O B-data I-data I-data I-data O O B-feature I-feature
139,Allows the attacker to get past some packet filtering devices,O O B-attacker O O O O B-technique I-technique B-system 
140,Allows the attacker to determine what kind of established connections a firewall or router will allow into a network by determining which ports through a firewall allow established connection responses,O O B-attacker O O O O O B-feature I-feature O B-tool O B-system O O O O B-system O O O B-feature O O B-tool O B-feature I-feature B-feature
141,"If no response or an ICMP Port Unreachable message is returned Nmap will label the target port as ""filtered meaning that a packet filter is blocking the response",O O B-feature O O B-data I-data I-data I-data O O B-tool O O O B-feature I-feature O B-feature O O O B-technique I-technique O B-feature O B-feature
142,Another very stealthy scan that sets all the TCP header flags to off or null ,O O B-technique I-technique O O O O B-feature I-feature I-feature O O O O 
143,This is not normally a valid packet and some hosts will not know what to do with this,O O O O O O B-data O O B-system  O O O O O O O O
144,Windows operating systems are in this group and scanning them with NULL scans will produce unreliable results ,B-system I-system I-system O O O O O B-technique O O B-technique I-technique O O O O 
145,However for non-Windows servers protected by a firewall this can be a way to get through,O O B-system I-system O O O B-tool O O O O O O O O
146,XMAS scan is similar to the NULL scan except for all the flags in the TCP header is set to on ,B-technique I-technique O O O O B-technique I-technique O O O O B-feature O O B-feature I-feature O O O O 
147,Windows machines wonât respond to this due to the way their TCP stack is implemented ,B-system I-system O B-feature O O O O O O Oir B-feature I-feature O O 
148,"Xmas scans derive their name from the set of flags that are turned on within a packet ",O O O O O O O O O B-feature O O O O O O B-data 
149,These scans are designed to manipulate the PSH URG and FIN flags of the TCP header,O B-technique O O O O O B-feature B-feature O B-feature I-feature O O B-feature I-feature
150,RPC scan is special type of scan looks for machines answering to RPC Remote Procedure Call services ,B-technique I-technique O O O O B-technique O O B-system O O B-function B-function I-function I-function B-apps 
151,RPC which allows remote commands to be run on the machine under certain conditions can be a dangerous service,B-function O O B-function I-function O O O O O B-system  O O O O O O O B-feature
152,Since RPC services can run on many different ports it is hard to tell from a normal scan which ones might be running RPC ,O B-app I-app O O O O O B-feature O O O O O O O O B-technique O O O O O B-function
153,This scan will probe the ports found open on a machine with commands to show the program name and version if RPC is running ,O B-technique O B-technique O B-feature O B-feature O O B-system O B-function O O O B-function B-feature O B-feature O B-function O O 
154,Itâs not a bad idea to run one of these scans every often to find out if and where you have these services running,O O O O O O B-function O O O B-technique O O O O O O O O O O O B-feature B-function
155,Scans RPC services using all discovered open TCP/UDP ports on the target to send RPC NULL commands ,B-technique B-app I-app O O O B-feature B-feature I-feature O O B-system O O B-function I-function I-function
156,Tries to determine if an RPC program is listening at the port and identifies type of RPC program,O O O O O B-function B-function O B-feature O O B-feature O O O O B-function B-function
157,IDLE scan is a super stealthy method whereby the scan packets are bounced off an external host,B-technique I-technique O O O B-technique I-technique O O B-technique B-data O O O O B-system I-system
158,You donât need to have control over the other host but it does have to set up and meet certain requirements ,O O O O O O O O O B-system O O O O O O O O O O B-feature 
159,"You must input the IP address of our ""zombie host and what port number to use",O O O O B-feature I-feature O O B-system I-system O O B-feature I-feature O O
160,It is one of the more controversial options in Nmap since it really only has a use for malicious attacks,O O O O O O O O O B-tool O O O O O O O O B-attack I-attack
161,Probe the zombieâs IP ID and record it Forge an SYN packet from the zombie and send it to the desired port on the target,B-technique O B-system B-feature I-feature O O O B-vulnerability O B-data I-data O O B-system O O O O O O B-feature O O B-system
162,Depending on the port state the targetâs reaction may or may not cause the zombieâs IP ID to be incre- mented,O O O B-feature I-feature O B-system O O O O O O O B-system B-feature I-feature O O O
163,Probe the zombieâs IP ID again The target port state is then determined by comparing this new IP ID ,B-technique O B-system B-feature I-feature O O B-system B-feature I-feature O O O O O O O B-feature I-feature
164,NSE stands for Nmap Scripting Engine,B-tool O O B-tool I-tool I-tool
165,and it is basically a digital library of Nmap scripts that help enhance the default Nmap features and report the results in a traditional Nmap output,O O O O O O O O B-function I-function O O O O B-feature B-tool B-feature O O O O O O O B-tool B-feature
166,You can also write and share your own scripts so youâre not limited to relying on the Nmap default NSE scripts,O O O O O O O O B-function O O O O O O O O B-tool B-feature B-function I-function
167,The only requirement for you to write these scripts is that they must be coded using the Lua programming language,O O O O O O O O B-function O O O O O O O O B-tool I-tool I-tool
168,Four different types can help us enhance the default Nmap features depending on the target and the scanning phase in which they are run,O O O O O O O O B-feature B-tool O O O O B-system  O O B-technique O O O O O B-function
169,Prerule scripts are types of scripts run before the rest of any scanning operation while Nmap doesnât have any data about the remote target,B-function I-function O O O B-function O O O O O O B-technique O O B-tool O O O B-data O O B-system I-system
170,Once the Nmap default scan has finished the host exploration detection port scanning or software discovery it will perform the host scripts,O O B-tool B-feature B-technique O O O B-system B-technique B-technique B-technique I-technique O B-technique I-technique O O O O B-function I-function
171,Service scripts are a particular set of Nmap scripts that are run against services on the remote host,B-function I-function O O O O O B-function I-function O O B-function O B-feature O O B-system I-system
172,These include HTTP service scriptsfor example which can be run against web servers,O O B-function I-function I-function O O O O O B-function O B-system I-system
173,Postrule scripts are run after the entire Nmap scan has finished and are often useful for parsing formatting and presenting the different results,B-function I-function O B-function O O O B-technique I-technique O O O O O O O B-function B-function O O O O O
174,When dealing with over 600 default Nmap scripts it is not easy to find the most popular ones by inspecting them one by one ,O O O O O B-feature B-function I-function O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

323,this causes a TCP RST packet to be sent back,O O O B-data I-data I-data O O O O
324,This is mainly useful for blocking ident 113/tcp probes which frequently occur when sending mail to broken mail hosts which wonât accept your mail otherwise,O O O O O B-featureB-feature I-feature B-technique O O O O O O O B-feature B-system I-system O O O O O O
325,Forging RST packets by firewalls and IDS or IPS is not particularly common outside of port 113,B-attack B-data I-data O B-tool O B-tool O B-tool O O O O O O B-feature I-feature
326,It can be confusing to legitimate network operators and allows scanners to immediately move on to the next port without waiting on the timeout caused by dropped packets ,O O O O O B-feature B-securityTeam I-securityTeam O O B-tool O O O O O O O B-feature O O O O B-feature O O B-data I-data

328,you can purposely alter some iptables rules and observe the difference and how the changes can impact your inferences about the firewall setup,O O O O O B-app B-function O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-tool B-system
329,One way to detect certain IDSs is to watch for unexplained gaps or suspicious machines in traceroutes ,O O O B-technique O B-tool O O O O O O O B-vulnerability B-system O B-tool 
330,While most operating systems include a traceroute command Nmap offers a faster and more effective alternative with the traceroute option,O O B-system I-system O O B-tool B-function B-tool O O O O O O O O O B-tool O
331,This approach may only detect inline IDSs instead of those that passively sniff the network without being part of the route ,O O O O B-technique B-feature B-tool O O O O B-feature B-technique O B-system O O O O O B-function 
332,Additionally inspect iptables rules and output from Nmap and ping and explain why the above-issued commands cannot return the path information,O B-technique B-app B-function O O O B-tool O B-function O O O O O B-function O O O O B-data
333,The following techniques are used to avoid being detected by the IDS snort ,O O O O O O O O B-technique O O B-tool B-tool 
334,Your snort can detect many scanning activities based on the given snort rules,O B-tool O B-technique O B-technique O O O O O B-function I-function

339,Nmap offers several timing modes that can be selected with the -T option to accomplish this ,B-tool O O B-feature I-feature O O O O O O O O O O O 
340,For example the -T paranoid option causes Nmap to send just one probe at a time waiting five minutes between them ,O O O O B-feature I-feature O B-tool O O O O B-technique O O O O O O O O 
341,A large scan may take weeks but at least it probably will not be detected ,O O B-technique O O O O O O O O O O O B-technique 
342,The -T sneaky option is similar but it only waits 15 seconds between probes ,O O B-feature I-feature O O O O O O O O O B-technique 
343,Scatter probes across networks rather than scanning hosts consecutively,O B-technique O B-system O O B-technique B-system O
344,IP fragments can be a major problem for intrusion detection systems,B-feature I-feature O O O O O O B-tool I-tool I-tool
345,particularly because the handling of oddities such as overlapping fragments and fragmentation assembly timeouts are ambiguous and differ substantially between platforms ,O O O O O O O O B-feature I-feature O B-feature I-feature I-feature O O O O O O B-system 
346,Thus the IDS often has to guess at how the remote system will interpret a packet,O O B-tool O O O O O O O B-system I-system O O O B-data
347,An Nmap scan will use tiny IP fragments ,O B-tool B-technique O O B-feature I-feature I-feature
348,By default Nmap will include up to eight bytes of data in each fragment so a typical 20 or 24 byte depending on options TCP packet is sent in three tiny fragments,O O B-tool O O O O O B-data O B-data O O B-feature O O typicOl O O O B-data O O O B-data I-data O O O O B-feature I-feature
349,Every instance of -f adds eight to the maximum fragment data size ,O O O O O O O O O B-feature B-feature I-feature 
350,Fragmentation is only supported for Nmapâs raw packet features including TCP and UDP port scans except connect scan and FTP bounce scan and OS detection,B-technique O O O O B-tool B-data I-data O O B-feature O B-feature B-technique I-technique O B-technique I-technique O B-technique I-technique I-technique O B-technique I-technique
351,Features such as version detection and the Nmap Scripting Engine generally donât support fragmentation ,B-feature O O B-technique I-technique O O B-tool I-tool I-tool O O O B-technique 
352,because they rely on your hostâs TCP stack to communicate with target services,O O O O O B-system B-feature I-feature O O O B-app I-app
353,Decoys are added with the -D option,B-technique O O O O O O
354,The argument is a list of hosts separated by commas ,O O O O O O B-system O O O O
355,The string ME can be used as one of the decoys to represent where the true source host should appear in the scan order ,O O O O O O O O O O B-technique O O O O O B-system I-system O O O O B-technique O 
356,source IP and Nmap will launch the requested port scan from that given source,B-system B-feature O B-tool O O O O B-technique I-technique O O O B-system  
357,No useful Nmap results will be available since the target will respond to the spoofed IP and Nmap will not see those responses,O O B-tool O O O O O O B-system O O O O B-vulnerability B-feature O B-tool O O O O B-feature
358,IDS alarms at the target will blame the spoofed source for the scan,B-tool B-function O O B-system O O O B-vulnerability O O O B-technique
359,This can be useful for framing innocent parties casting doubt in the administratorâs mind about his IDS accuracy,O O O O O O O O O O O O B-securityTeam O O O B-tool B-feature
360,The idle scan is a clever technique that allows for spoofing the source IP address as discussed in the previous section while still obtaining accurate TCP port scan results ,O B-O I-O O O O O O O O B-vulnerability O B-system B-feature I-feature O O O O O O O O O O B-technique I-technique I-technique O 
361,This is done by abusing the properties of the IP identification field as implemented by many systems ,O O O O O O O O O B-feature I-feature I-feature O O O O  B-system 
362,However most Linux systems are immune to idle scan attacks,O O B-system I-system O O O B-attack I-attack I-attack
363,Nmap performs reverse-DNS resolution by default against every responsive host ,B-tool O B-function I-function O O O O B-feature B-system 
364,These DNS lookup probes could be detected Even something as unintrusive as a list scan -sL could be detected this way ,O B-function I-function B-technique O O B-technique O O O B-feature O O B-technique I-technique O O O B-technique O O
365,The probes will come from the DNS server configured for the machine running Nmap,O B-technique O O O O B-system I-system B-function O O B-system O B-tool
366,The most effective way to eliminate this risk is to specify -n to disable all reverse DNS resolution ,O O O O O O O B-feature O O O O O O O B-function I-function I-function
367,You can specify one or more of those name servers to the dns-servers option of Nmap and all DNS queries will be proxied through them,O O O O O O O O B-system I-system O O B-system I-system O O B-tool O O B-function I-function O O B-system  O O
368,The scanning results derived from task 1 to task 3 allows you to identify potential vulnerabilities to explore ,O B-technique O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-technique

463,The allowance of null sessions was enabled by default on legacy systems but has been disabled from Windows XP SP2 and Windows Server 2003 ,O O O B-feature I-feature O O O O O B-system I-system O O O O O B-system I-system I-system O B-system I-system I-system
464,The connection uses port 445 an open port on the out target host as weâve seen in the port scan results,O B-feature O B-feature I-feature O B-feature I-feature O O O B-system I-system O O O O O B-technique I-technique O
465,Now you can open up a new terminal window and set up a null session with the Metasploitable 2 samba server,O O O O O O O B-system B-system O O O O B-feature I-feature O O B-system I-system B-system I-system
466,It will ask for a password and you can press âenter ,O O O O O B-feature O O O O O 
467,Then you can use the following command to enumerate all the users in the system,O O O O O O B-function O B-function O O B-user O O B-system O
468,Enum4linux can be found on Kali Linux ,B-tool O O O O B-system I-system 
469,It is used to enumerate Windows and Samba hosts and is written in Perl ,O O O O B-function B-system O B-system B-system  O O O O B-tool 
470,The tool is basically a wrapper for smbclient rpcclient net and nmblookup ,O O O O O B-function O B-system B-system O O B-tool
471,Letâs have a look at how to use enum4linux and run it on Metasploitable 2 ,O O O O O O O O B-tool O O O O B-system I-system 
472,Below are the most common options used in enum4linux ,O O O O O O O O B-tool 
473,In the Metasploit console you can gather information such as target IP address Operating System ports opened and vulnerability,O O B-tool B-tool O O O B-data O O B-system B-feature I-feature B-system I-system B-feature B-feature O B-vulnerability
474,Metasploit allows you to run Nmap directly from the console ,B-tool O O O O B-tool O O O B-tool 
475,Nmap output contained over 600 lines therefore the output was shortened leaving relevant information to be explained,B-tool B-feature O O O O O O B-feature O O O O B-data O O O
476,The following lines show us the initialized scans types which involve NSE ARP Ping Scan DNS resolution and an SYN Stealth Scan,O O O O O O O B-technique O O O B-tool B-technique I-technique I-technique B-function I-function O O B-technique I-technique I-technique
477,The next extract shows what services are available at the target,O O O O O B-app O O O O B-system
478,The following extract report NSE post scan scripts execution to find vulnerabilities,O O O O B-tool B-function I-function I-function O O O B-vulnerability
479,As you can see Nmap already found security holes or vulnerabilities on the target FTP service it even links us exploits to hack the target,O O O O B-tool O O B-vulnerability I-vulnerability O B-vulnerability O O B-system B-app I-app O O O O B-function O B-attack O B-system
480,Once you identified security holes on your target use Metasploit commands to find proper exploits against them ,O O O B-vulnerability I-vulnerability O Or B-system O B-tool B-function O O O B-function O O 
481,As you saw previously one of the first vulnerabilities found was on the vsFTPD server to find proper exploits ,O O O O O O O O B-vulnerability O O O O B-system I-system O O O B-function 
482,As you see Metasploit contains a backdoor which possibly may help us to hack our target FTP ,O O O B-tool O O B-attack O O O O O O B-attack O B-system B-feature 
483,To use this exploit within Metasploit run,O O O B-function O B-tool O
484,After the command shell ie the backdoor is established then you can run command âls in the targeting system,O O B-tool I-tool O O B-attack O O O O O O B-function B-function O O B-system I-system
485,Syslog is one of the most important standards used in Linux as it is the key file which helps you determine the different level of logs which are getting generated and stored every second while you are working on your Linux box,B-tool O O O O O O O O O B-system O O O O O B-data O O O O O O O O B-data O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-system I-system

"
495,When configure syslog syslogconf is the one for syslogd and rsyslog configures are set up in the /etc/rsyslogd/ folder every rule consists of two fields a selector field and an action field ,O B-function B-tool B-data O O O O B-data O B-tool B-function O O O O O B-feature B-data O B-function O O O B-feature O B-feature I-feature O O B-feature I-feature 
496,These two fields are separated by one or more spaces or tabs ,O O B-feature O O O O O O O O O 
497,The selector field specifies a pattern of facilities and priorities belonging to the specified action,O B-feature I-feature O O O O O O O O O O O B-feature
498,The selector field itself again consists of two parts a facility and a priority separated by a period,O B-feature I-feature O O O O O O O B-system O O B-feature O O O O
499,The facility is one of the following keywords: auth authpriv cron daemon kern lpr mail mark news security same as auth syslog user uucp and local0 through local7 ,O B-feature O O O O O O B-feature O B-feature O B-feature O B-tool O B-app O B-system O B-app O B-feature O B-feature O B-technique O O B-feature O B-tool O B-user O B-feature O B-feature O B-feature 
500,The keyword security should not be used anymore and mark is only for internal use and therefore should not be used in applications,O O B-technique O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-app
501,You may want to specify and redirect these messages here,O O O O O O O O B-data O
502,The facility specifies the subsystem that produced the message ie all mail programs log with the mail facility LOG MAIL if they log using syslog ,O B-system O O B-system O O O B-data O O B-app I-app B-function O O B-app B-system B-app I-app O O B-function O B-tool 
503,The priority is one of the following keywords in ascending order: debug info notice warning warn same as warning err error same as err crit alert emerg panic same as emerg ,O B-feature O O O O O O O O O B-technique B-data B-data B-data B-feature O O B-data B-feature B-data O O B-data B-feature B-data B-feature B-feature O O B-feature 
504,The keywords error warn and panic are deprecated and should not be used anymore,O O B-data B-feature O B-feature O O O O O O O O
505,The priority defines the severity of the message,O B-feature O O B-feature O O B-data
506,Multiple selectors may be specified for a single action using the semicolon â separator ,O B-feature O O O O O O O O O O O O
507,The following presented modifications provide network support to the syslogd facility ,O O O O O B-technique I-technique O O B-data B-system 
508,For examples if we want to log all the critical events on your Linux machine in a separate log file inside /var/log with a name of criticallog ,O O O O O O B-function O O B-feature O O O B-system I-system O O O B-data I-data O B-feature O O O O B-data

511,Log all the firewall warning level messages,B-function O O B-tool B-data O B-data
512,Network support means that messages can be forwarded from one node running syslogd to another node running syslogd where they will be actually logged to a disk file,B-technique I-technique O O B-data O O O O O B-system O B-data O O B-system O B-data O O O O O B-function O O B-data I-data
513,The strategy is to have syslogd listen on a Unix/Linux domain socket for locally generated log messages ,O O O O O B-data O O O B-system B-feature I-feature O O O B-data I-data 
514,This behavior will allow syslogd to inter-operate with the syslog found in the standard C library ,O O O O B-data O O O O B-tool O O O B-app I-app I-app 
515,At the same time syslogd listens on the standard syslog port for messages forwarded from other hosts ,O O O O B-data O O O O B-app B-feature O B-data O O O B-system 
516,If this entry is missing syslogd neither can receive remote messages nor send them because the UDP port cannot be opened ,O O O O O B-data O O O B-feature B-data O O O O O B-feature I-feature O O O 
517,Instead syslogd will die immediately blowing out an error message ,O B-app O O O O O O B-data I-data 
518,For example to forward ALL messages to a remote host uses the following syslogconf entry,O O O O O B-data O O O O O O O O O

533,In ubuntu distribution rsyslogd is the default system log implementation compared to its precursor syslogd ,O B-system I-system B-data O O O B-data I-data O O O O O B-data 
534,In this lab you will learn and practice on how to setup rsyslog forwarding from a client to a centralized server ,O O O O O O O O O O O B-system B-tool B-feature O O B-system O O B-system I-system 
535,The syslog basics are presented in the Syslog syslogd Local Logging on Linux Since rsyslog is a successor of syslog the basic concepts of log facilities actions and priority are the same,O B-tool O O O O O B-tool B-data B-feature B-function O B-system O B-tool O O O O B-tool O O O O B-data B-system B-feature O B-feature O O O
536,On Ubuntu system instead of using syslogconf rsyslog uses rsyslog as it configuration file,O B-system I-system O O O B-data I-data B-tool O B-tool O O B-data I-data
537,Detailed rsyslog configuration files are maintained under /etc/rsyslogd/ folder ,O B-tool B-data I-data O O O B-feature B-data 
538,Default rsyslog setup configurations are maintained in the file 50-defaultconf which is similar to syslogconf using syslogd ,B-feature B-tool B-feature I-feature O O O O B-data B-data O O O O B-data O B-data 
539,"In the following sections Selectors Facility and Severity Levels we use the same descriptions

"
540,Logs are stored at /var/log/ on the Linux filesystem ,B-data O O O B-feature O O B-system B-system 
541,At this location you should see multiple log files each one having a name describing what they actually store ,O O B-system O O O O O B-data I-data O O O O O O O O O O O 
542,In this example you have dedicated log files for authentication purposes or for kernel related logs ,O O O O O O B-data I-data O B-technique O O O B-app O B-data 
543,The folder /var/log does not contain only files but it also contain dedicated folders that vendors create when the application is installed,O B-data B-feature O O O O B-data O O O O O B-data O B-user O O O B-app O B-function
544,Suppose that three machines are sending logs to the log server each machine is going to have its own own authlog kernlog or dpkglog files,O O O B-system O O B-data O O B-system I-system O B-system O O O O O O B-data B-data O B-data B-data
545,Each machine ie a client wants to write logs via rsyslog To this end each machine is configured as client-server syslog instances ,O B-system O O B-system O O O B-data O B-tool O O O O B-system O B-function O B-system B-tool B-system 
546,They can create logs and store logs locally in their file system In the centralized logging architecture client machines will be configured to use rsyslog as a client and they will forward every single log to a remote rsyslog server,O O O B-data O O B-data O O O B-system I-system O O B-system I-system I-system B-system I-system O O B-function O O B-tool O O B-system O O O B-feature O O B-data O O B-system I-system I-system
547,which is the central server,O O O B-system I-system

550,Increase the reliability: implement a memory caching module to address when the network is down,O O B-technique: O O B-technique I-technique B-function O O O O B-system O B-feature
551,Using the centralized logging architecture we can achieve the following benefits,O O B-system I-system I-system O O O O O O
552,Inspect all your logs from a single place instead of accessing individual machine,B-technique O O B-data O O O O O O O O B-system

554,Set up a complete log monitoring infrastructure in one place to improve the network management capability,O O O O B-technique I-technique B-system O O O O O O B-technique I-technique O
555,The downside of using centralized logging server,O O O O B-system I-system I-system
556,The syslog server can be overloaded: with this architecture you are pushing logs to a remote server ,O B-system I-system O O O O O B-system O O O B-data O O B-system I-system 
557,if one machine starts sending excessive amount of log data it may overload the log server,O O B-system O O O O O B-data I-data O O O O B-system I-system
558,The centralized system suffers single-point failure ,O B-system I-system O B-feature I-feature 
559,If the log server goes down then the ability to look at all the logs sent by the clients is lost ,O O B-system I-system O O O O O O O O O O B-data O O O B-system O O 
560,Moreover if the server goes down clients will start storing messages locally until the server is available again thus it may fill up disk space on the client side,O O O B-system O O B-system O O O B-data B-feature O O B-system O O O O O O O O B-system I-system O O B-system I-system
561,The implementation of syslog on Ubuntu is rsyslogd ,O O O B-tool O B-system O B-data
562,To determine if rsyslogd is installed on Ubuntu,O O O B-data O O O B-system
563,First of all you have to configure your rsyslog server for it to accept incoming logs on port 514 ,O O O O O O B-function Or B-system I-system O O O O O B-data O B-feature I-feature 
564,We are going to use TCP for log transmission ,O O O O O B-feature O B-feature I-feature 
565,You can use UDP if the network reliability is not a big concern ,O O O B-feature O O B-technique I-technique O O O O O 
566,This is the directory that stores templates as well as files that contain the rsyslog rules,O O O B-data O O B-feature O O O B-data O O O B-function I-function
567,In this directory there is a 50-defaultconf file ,O O B-data O O O B-data I-data
568,You are going to create your own configuration file prefixing it with a number lower than the configuration file one ,O O O O O O O B-data I-data O O O O O O O O B-data I-data O 
569,In this way your configuration file takes priority over the default one,O O O O B-data I-data O O O O B-feature O
570,Remote Server means to send for every facility and every severity to the remote server template,B-system I-system O O O O O B-system O O B-feature O O B-system I-system B-feature
571,rsyslog properties and they together identify the path where data will be stored on the remote server,B-tool O O O O O O B-feature O B-data O O O O O B-system I-system
572,With this syntax log files will be grouped by hostname aka the computer name sending the log and then by syslog facility kern user auth etc ,O O O B-data I-data O O O O B-feature O O B-feature I-feature O O B-data O O O B-tool B-system  B-app B-user B-feature O 
573,Now you can restart the rsyslog server and make sure that it is now listening on the port 514 for TCP,O O O B-function O B-system I-system O O O O O O O B-feature O O B-feature I-feature O B-feature
574,With this configuration file server logs are no longer directly stored  ,O O B-data I-data B-system B-data O O O O O  
575,hostname being the current name of the host ,B-feature O O O O O O B-system
576,Now letâs configure rsyslog as a client and on the client machine,O O B-function B-tool O O B-system O O O B-system I-system
577,Similarly to the procedure done on the server-side ,O O O O O O O B-system
578,Restart the rsyslog server and make sure that there are no errors on the client-side,B-function O B-system I-system O O O O O O O B-data O O B-system
579,Now on the server side folder is created for the client with the hostname ubuntu ,O O O B-system I-system B-data O O O O B-system O O B-feature B-system 
580,You are successfully received the log file from the client,O O O O O B-data I-data O O B-system
581,Now you can practice a customized logging service for one of your client ,O O O O O O B-app I-app O O O O B-system 
582,In this task we assume that you want to send a subset of logs captured on your client to the log server ,O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-data O O O B-system O O B-system I-system 
583,Assume that you are currently logging all the kernel related messages in separate log file ,O O O O O B-function O O B-app O B-data O O B-data I-data
584,Assume that you are currently logging all the firewall warning level messages ,O O O O O B-function O O B-tool B-data O B-data
585,Restart the rsyslog server and make sure that there are no errors on the client-side,B-function O B-system I-system O O O O O O O B-data O O B-system
586,How to modify the iptables rules to let it log at the appropriate level,O O O O B-app B-function O O O B-function O O O O
587,How to configure syslog to log the iptables messages to a different log file,O O B-function B-tool O B-function O B-app B-data O O O B-data I-data
588,To stop iptables messages to get logged into a remote server,O O B-app B-data O O B-function O O B-system I-system
589,Make sure the iptables rule is logging at the appropriate level ,O O O B-app B-function O B-function O O O O 
590,This can be done by using the log-level switch ,O O O O O O O B-function I-function 
591,Default log-level is warning ,B-feature B-feature O B-data 
592,Now you can run ssh and ping to test your firewall logs received at the server side,O O O B-function B-function O B-function O B-function O B-tool B-data O O O B-system I-system
