D2,66,What is Nmap,O O B-tool
D2,67,Nmap is a network scanning tool that uses IP packets to identify all the devices connected to a network and provide information on the services and operating systems they are running,B-tool O O B-technique I-technique B-tool O O B-data I-data O O O O B-system O O O B-system O O B-data O O B-app O B-system I-system O O O
D2,68, The program is most commonly used via a command-line interface though GUI front-ends are also available,O O O O O O O O B-tool I-tool O B-tool I-tool O O O
D2,69,It is available for many different operating systems such as Linux Free BSD and Gentoo,O O O O O O B-system I-system O O B-system B-system I-system O B-system
D2,70,Nmap was developed for enterprise-scale networks and can scan through thousands of connected devices,B-tool O O O B-system I-system I-system O O B-function O O O B-system I-system
D2,71,Moreover Nmap has been increasingly used to inspect IoT security,O B-tool O O O O O O B-technique I-technique
D2,72,Nmap provides information on every active IP so you can determine if an IP is being used by a legitimate service or an external attacker,B-tool O B-data O O B-feature B-feature O O O O O O B-feature O O O O O B-feature B-app O O B-attacker I-attacker
D2,73,Your network as a whole including live hosts open ports and the OS of every connected device,O B-system O O O O B-system I-system B-feature I-feature O O B-system O O B-system I-system
D2,74,Vulnerabilities scan your own server to simulate the process that a hacker would use to attack your site,B-vulnerability B-function O O B-system O O O B-technique O O B-attacker O O O B-attack O B-system
D2,75,The primary uses of Nmap can be broken into three core processes,O O O O B-tool O O O O O O B-technique
D2,76,First the program gives you detailed information on every IP active on your networks and each IP can then be scanned,O O O O O O B-data O O B-feature B-feature O O B-system O O B-feature O O O B-function
D2,77,"This allows administratorsto check whether an IP is being used by a legitimate service or an external attacker",O O B-securityTeam O O O O B-feature O O O O O B-feature I-feature O O B-attacker I-attacker
D2,78,Secondly Nmap provides information on your network as a whole,O B-tool O B-data O O B-system O O O
D2,79,It can be used to provide a list of live hosts and open ports and identify the OS of every connected device,O O O O O O O O O B-system I-system O B-feature I-feature O O O B-system O O B-system I-system
D2,80,This makes it a valuable tool in ongoing system monitoring and a critical part of pentesting,O O O O O B-tool O O B-technique I-technique O O O O O B-technique
D2,81,Nmap can be used alongside the Metasploit framework for instance to probe and then repair network vulnerabilities,B-tool O O O O O B-tool I-tool O O O B-technique O On O B-vulnerability I-vulnerability
D2,82,Thirdly Nmap has also become a valuable tool for users looking to protect personal and business websites,O B-tool O O O O O B-tool O B-user O O O B-system O B-system I-system
D2,83,Using Nmap to scan your own web server particularly if you are hosting your website from home is essentially simulating a hacker process to attack your site,O B-tool O B-technique O O B-system I-system O O O O B-feature O B-system  O B-system O O O O B-attacker B-technique O B-attack O B-system
D2,84,Attacking your own site in this way is a powerful way of identifying security vulnerabilities,B-attack O O B-system O O O O O O O O O B-vulnerability I-vulnerability
D2,85,Nmap is straightforward to use and most of the tools it provides are familiar to system admins from other programs,B-tool O O O O O O O O B-tool O O O O O  B-securityTeam I-securityTeam O O B-function
D2,86,Nmap advantage is that it brings a wide range of these tools into one program rather than forcing you to skip between separate and discrete network monitoring tools,B-tool O O O O O O O O O O B-tool O O B-function O O O O O O O O O O B-technique I-technique B-tool
D2,87, To use Nmap you need to be familiar with command-line interfaces, O O B-tool O O O O O O B-tool I-tool I-tool
D2,88,Most advanced users can write scripts to automate common tasks but this is unnecessary for basic network monitoring,O O B-user O O B-function O B-feature O O O O O O O O B-technique I-technique
D2,89,TCP Full Connect Vanilla Scan,B-technique I-technique I-technique I-technique I-technique
D2,90,we assume that the scanning targetâs IP address ,O O O O B-technique B-system B-feature I-feature
D2,91,TCP Connect scan completes the 3-way handshake,B-technique I-technique I-technique O O B-technique I-technique 
D2,92,If a port is open the operating system completed the TCP three-way handshake and the port scanner immediately closes the connection to avoid DOS ,O O B-feature O B-feature O B-system I-system O O B-feature B-technique I-technique I-technique O O B-tool I-tool O O O B-feature O O B-attack 
D2,93,"This is ""noisy because the services can log the sender IP address and trigger Intrusion Detection Systems",O O B-feature O O B-feature O B-function O B-system B-feature I-feature O O B-tool I-tool I-tool
D2,94,the Full scan has the following features,O B-technique I-technique O O O O
D2,95,Attempts to completes 3-way handshake with each scanned port,O O O B-technique I-technique I-technique O O B-vulnerability B-feature
D2,96,Sends SYN and waits for ACK before sending ACK,B-function B-feature O O O B-feature O B-function B-feature
D2,97,Tears down connection using FIN packets,B-feature I-feature B-feature O B-data I-data
D2,98,If target port is closed sender will received either no response a RESET packet  or an ICMP Port Unreachable packet,O B-feature I-feature O B-feature O B-system O B-function O O B-feature O O B-data I-data O O On B-data I-data I-data I-data
D2,99,Not stealthy the connection request can be logged,O B-vulnerability O B-feature I-feature O O B-function
D2,100,UDP scan checks to see if any UDP ports are listening ,B-technique I-technique O O O O O B-feature I-feature O B-feature 
D2,101,Since UDP does not respond with a positive acknowledgment like TCP and only responds to an incoming UDP packet when the port is closed this type of scan can sometimes show false positives ,O B-feature O O B-feature O O B-feature I-feature O B-feature O O B-feature O O B-feature B-data I-data O O B-feature O B-feature O O O B-technique O O O B-feature I-feature 
D2,102,However it can also reveal Trojan horses running on high UDP ports and hidden RPC services,O O O O B-feature B-attack I-attack O O B-feature I-feature I-feature  O B-vulnerability I-vulnerability I-vulnerability
D2,103,It may be quite slow since some machines intentionally slow down responses to this kind of traffic to avoid being overwhelmed ,O O O O O O O B-system O B-feature I-feature I-feature O O O O B-data O O O O 
D2,104,Machines running Windows OS however do not implement this slowdown feature so you should use UDP to scan Windows hosts normally,B-system O B-system I-system O O O O O B-feature I-feature O O O O B-feature O B-technique B-system B-system  O
D2,105,The UDP Scan sends a UDP packet to target ports to determine if a UDP service is listening,O B-technique I-technique O O B-data I-data O B-feature I-feature O O O O B-feature I-feature O B-feature
D2,106,If the target system returns an ICMP Port Unreachable message the target port is closed Otherwise the target port is assumed to be open,O O B-system I-system O O B-data I-data I-data I-data O B-feature I-feature O B-feature O O B-feature I-feature O O O O B-feature
D2,107,UDP scan is unreliable since there may be false positives,B-technique I-technique O O O O O O B-feature I-feature
D2,108,The UDP scan can be very slow due to the following reasons,O B-technique I-technique O O O B-feature O O O O O
D2,109,Open and filtered ports rarely send any response leaving Nmap to time out,B-feature O B-feature I-feature O B-function O B-feature O B-tool O B-feature I-feature
D2,110,Closed ports usually send back an ICMP port unreachable error But many hosts rate limit ICMP port unreachable messages by default eg 1/sec,B-feature I-feature O O O O B-data I-data I-data I-data O O B-system B-technique I-technique B-data I-data I-data I-data O B-feature O O
D2,111,To speed up the UDP scan Increase host parallelism use min-hostgroup to scan multiple hosts at once,O O O O B-technique I-technique O B-feature I-feature O B-feature I-feature O B-technique O B-system O O
D2,112,Scan popular ports first using the -F option to scan the most common UDP ports,B-technique O B-feature O O O O O O B-technique O O O B-feature I-feature
D2,113,Add version-intensity 0 to version detection scans,O B-feature I-feature O O B-technique I-technique B-technique
D2,114,Scan from behind the firewall,B-technique O B-feature I-feature I-feature 
D2,115,Use host-timeout to skip slow hosts,O B-feature I-feature O O B-system I-system
D2,116,Use -v verbosity and chill out Nmap provides estimated time for scan completion of each host,O O B-feature O B-feature I-feature B-tool O O O O B-technique O O O B-system
D2,117,SYN scan is another form of TCP scanning ,B-technique I-technique O O O O B-technique I-technique 
D2,118,Rather than using the operating systemâs network functions the port scanner generates raw IP packets and monitors for responses ,O O O O B-system I-system  B-function I-function O B-tool I-tool O B-data I-data I-data O B-technique O B-feature 
D2,119,This scan type is also known as â€œhalf-open scanning because it never actually opens a full TCP connection ,O B-technique O O O O O B-technique I-technique O O O O B-feature O B-feature I-feature I-feature 
D2,120,The port scanner generates a SYN packet ,O B-tool I-tool O O B-data I-data 
D2,121,If the target port is open it will respond with an SYN-ACK packet,O O B-feature I-feature O B-feature O O B-feature O O B-data I-data 
D2,122,The scanner host responds with an RST packet closing the connection before the handshake is completed,O B-tool B-system B-feature O O B-data I-data B-feature O B-feature O O B-technique O O
D2,123,If the port is closed but unfiltered the target will instantly respond with an RST packet ,O O B-feature O B-feature O B-feature O B-system O O B-feature O O B-data I-data 
D2,124,There is debate over which scan is less intrusive on the target host ,O O O O O B-technique O O B-attack O O B-system I-system
D2,125,SYN scan has the advantage that the individual services never actually receive a connection,B-technique I-technique O O O O O O B-feature O O B-function O B-feature
D2,126,Only sends the initial SYN and waits for ACK to detect open port,O O O O B-feature O O O B-feature O B-technique B-feature I-feature
D2,127,SYN scans stop two-thirds of the way through the 3-way handshake aka half-open scan,B-technique I-technique O O O O O O O B-technique I-technique O B-technique  I-technique
D2,128,Attacker sends a RESET RST after receiving an SYN-ACK response,B-attacker O O B-feature I-feature O B-feature O B-feature I-feature 
D2,129,A true connection is never established thus the target may not log the connection,O O B-feature O O B-feature O O B-system O O B-function O B-feature
D2,130,Faster and stealthier than a full TCP Connect scans,O O B-vulnerability O O B-technique I-technique I-technique I-technique
D2,131,If the target port is closed the destination will send a RESET or nothing,O O B-feature I-feature O B-feature O B-system O O O B-feature O O
D2,132,SYN flood may cause accidental denial-of-service attacks if the target is slow,B-attack I-attack O O B-attack B-attack I-attack O O B-system O B-feature
D2,133,FIN scan is a stealthy scan like the SYN scan but sends a TCP FIN packet instead ,B-technique I-technique O O B-technique I-technique O O B-technique I-technique O B-function O B-data I-data I-data O
D2,134,Most but not all computers will send an RST packet back if they get this input so that the FIN scan can show false positives and negatives but it may get under the radar of some IDS programs and other countermeasures,O O O O O O O O B-data I-data O O O O O B-feature O O O B-technique I-technique O O B-feature I-feature O B-feature O O O O O O O O O B-tool B-function O O O
D2,135,Ack scanning determines whether the port is filtered or not ,B-technique I-technique O O O B-feature O B-feature O O 
D2,136,This is especially good when attempting to probe for the existence of a firewall and its rulesets ,O O O O O O O B-technique O O O O O B-tool O O B-function 
D2,137,Simple packet filtering will allow established connections packets with the ACK bit set whereas a more sophisticated stateful firewall might not,O B-technique I-technique O O B-feature I-feature B-data O O I-data I-data O O O O O B-feature B-tool O O
D2,138,ACK scan Sends a packet with the ACK code bit set to each target port,B-technique I-technique O O B-data O O B-data I-data I-data I-data O O B-feature I-feature
D2,139,Allows the attacker to get past some packet filtering devices,O O B-attacker O O O O B-technique I-technique B-system 
D2,140,Allows the attacker to determine what kind of established connections a firewall or router will allow into a network by determining which ports through a firewall allow established connection responses,O O B-attacker O O O O O B-feature I-feature O B-tool O B-system O O O O B-system O O O B-feature O O B-tool O B-feature I-feature B-feature
D2,141,"If no response or an ICMP Port Unreachable message is returned Nmap will label the target port as ""filtered meaning that a packet filter is blocking the response",O O B-feature O O B-data I-data I-data I-data O O B-tool O O O B-feature I-feature O B-feature O O O B-technique I-technique O B-feature O B-feature
D2,142,Another very stealthy scan that sets all the TCP header flags to off or null ,O O B-technique I-technique O O O O B-feature I-feature I-feature O O O O 
D2,143,This is not normally a valid packet and some hosts will not know what to do with this,O O O O O O B-data O O B-system  O O O O O O O O
D2,144,Windows operating systems are in this group and scanning them with NULL scans will produce unreliable results ,B-system I-system I-system O O O O O B-technique O O B-technique I-technique O O O O 
D2,145,However for non-Windows servers protected by a firewall this can be a way to get through,O O B-system I-system O O O B-tool O O O O O O O O
D2,146,XMAS scan is similar to the NULL scan except for all the flags in the TCP header is set to on ,B-technique I-technique O O O O B-technique I-technique O O O O B-feature O O B-feature I-feature O O O O 
D2,147,Windows machines wonât respond to this due to the way their TCP stack is implemented ,B-system I-system O B-feature O O O O O O Oir B-feature I-feature O O 
D2,148,"Xmas scans derive their name from the set of flags that are turned on within a packet ",O O O O O O O O O B-feature O O O O O O B-data 
D2,149,These scans are designed to manipulate the PSH URG and FIN flags of the TCP header,O B-technique O O O O O B-feature B-feature O B-feature I-feature O O B-feature I-feature
D2,150,RPC scan is special type of scan looks for machines answering to RPC Remote Procedure Call services ,B-technique I-technique O O O O B-technique O O B-system O O B-function B-function I-function I-function B-apps 
D2,151,RPC which allows remote commands to be run on the machine under certain conditions can be a dangerous service,B-function O O B-function I-function O O O O O B-system  O O O O O O O B-feature
D2,152,Since RPC services can run on many different ports it is hard to tell from a normal scan which ones might be running RPC ,O B-app I-app O O O O O B-feature O O O O O O O O B-technique O O O O O B-function
D2,153,This scan will probe the ports found open on a machine with commands to show the program name and version if RPC is running ,O B-technique O B-technique O B-feature O B-feature O O B-system O B-function O O O B-function B-feature O B-feature O B-function O O 
D2,154,Itâs not a bad idea to run one of these scans every often to find out if and where you have these services running,O O O O O O B-function O O O B-technique O O O O O O O O O O O B-feature B-function
D2,155,Scans RPC services using all discovered open TCP/UDP ports on the target to send RPC NULL commands ,B-technique B-app I-app O O O B-feature B-feature I-feature O O B-system O O B-function I-function I-function
D2,156,Tries to determine if an RPC program is listening at the port and identifies type of RPC program,O O O O O B-function B-function O B-feature O O B-feature O O O O B-function B-function
D2,157,IDLE scan is a super stealthy method whereby the scan packets are bounced off an external host,B-technique I-technique O O O B-technique I-technique O O B-technique B-data O O O O B-system I-system
D2,158,You donât need to have control over the other host but it does have to set up and meet certain requirements ,O O O O O O O O O B-system O O O O O O O O O O B-feature 
D2,159,"You must input the IP address of our ""zombie host and what port number to use",O O O O B-feature I-feature O O B-system I-system O O B-feature I-feature O O
D2,160,It is one of the more controversial options in Nmap since it really only has a use for malicious attacks,O O O O O O O O O B-tool O O O O O O O O B-attack I-attack
D2,161,Probe the zombieâs IP ID and record it Forge an SYN packet from the zombie and send it to the desired port on the target,B-technique O B-system B-feature I-feature O O O B-vulnerability O B-data I-data O O B-system O O O O O O B-feature O O B-system
D2,162,Depending on the port state the targetâs reaction may or may not cause the zombieâs IP ID to be incre- mented,O O O B-feature I-feature O B-system O O O O O O O B-system B-feature I-feature O O O
D2,163,Probe the zombieâs IP ID again The target port state is then determined by comparing this new IP ID ,B-technique O B-system B-feature I-feature O O B-system B-feature I-feature O O O O O O O B-feature I-feature
D2,164,NSE stands for Nmap Scripting Engine,B-tool O O B-tool I-tool I-tool
D2,165,and it is basically a digital library of Nmap scripts that help enhance the default Nmap features and report the results in a traditional Nmap output,O O O O O O O O B-function I-function O O O O B-feature B-tool B-feature O O O O O O O B-tool B-feature
D2,166,You can also write and share your own scripts so youâre not limited to relying on the Nmap default NSE scripts,O O O O O O O O B-function O O O O O O O O B-tool B-feature B-function I-function
D2,167,The only requirement for you to write these scripts is that they must be coded using the Lua programming language,O O O O O O O O B-function O O O O O O O O B-tool I-tool I-tool
D2,168,Four different types can help us enhance the default Nmap features depending on the target and the scanning phase in which they are run,O O O O O O O O B-feature B-tool O O O O B-system  O O B-technique O O O O O B-function

D3,320,For example the Linux iptables system which offers many methods for rejecting undesired packets by using:,O O O B-system B-app B-system O O O O O O O B-data O O
D3,321,The type given can be icmp-net-unreachable icmp-host-unreachable icmp-port-unreachable icmp-proto-unreachable icmp-net-prohibited or icmp-host-prohibited which return the appropriate ICMP error message port-unreachable is the default ,O O O O O B-feature B-feature B-featureB-feature B-feature O B-feature O O O O B-data I-data I-data B-feature O O O

D3,329,One way to detect certain IDSs is to watch for unexplained gaps or suspicious machines in traceroutes ,O O O B-technique O B-tool O O O O O O O B-vulnerability B-system O B-tool 
D3,330,While most operating systems include a traceroute command Nmap offers a faster and more effective alternative with the traceroute option,O O B-system I-system O O B-tool B-function B-tool O O O O O O O O O B-tool O

D3,339,Nmap offers several timing modes that can be selected with the -T option to accomplish this ,B-tool O O B-feature I-feature O O O O O O O O O O O 
D3,340,For example the -T paranoid option causes Nmap to send just one probe at a time waiting five minutes between them ,O O O O B-feature I-feature O B-tool O O O O B-technique O O O O O O O O 
D3,341,A large scan may take weeks but at least it probably will not be detected ,O O B-technique O O O O O O O O O O O B-technique

D3,343,Scatter probes across networks rather than scanning hosts consecutively,O B-technique O B-system O O B-technique B-system O
D3,344,IP fragments can be a major problem for intrusion detection systems,B-feature I-feature O O O O O O B-tool I-tool I-tool

D3,346,Thus the IDS often has to guess at how the remote system will interpret a packet,O O B-tool O O O O O O O B-system I-system O O O B-data
D3,347,An Nmap scan will use tiny IP fragments ,O B-tool B-technique O O B-feature I-feature I-feature
D3,348,By default Nmap will include up to eight bytes of data in each fragment so a typical 20 or 24 byte depending on options TCP packet is sent in three tiny fragments,O O B-tool O O O O O B-data O B-data O O B-feature O O typicOl O O O B-data O O O B-data I-data O O O O B-feature I-feature
D3,349,Every instance of -f adds eight to the maximum fragment data size ,O O O O O O O O O B-feature B-feature I-feature 
D3,350,Fragmentation is only supported for Nmapâs raw packet features including TCP and UDP port scans except connect scan and FTP bounce scan and OS detection,B-technique O O O O B-tool B-data I-data O O B-feature O B-feature B-technique I-technique O B-technique I-technique O B-technique I-technique I-technique O B-technique I-technique
D3,351,Features such as version detection and the Nmap Scripting Engine generally donât support fragmentation ,B-feature O O B-technique I-technique O O B-tool I-tool I-tool O O O B-technique 
D3,352,because they rely on your hostâs TCP stack to communicate with target services,O O O O O B-system B-feature I-feature O O O B-app I-app

D3,356,source IP and Nmap will launch the requested port scan from that given source,B-system B-feature O B-tool O O O O B-technique I-technique O O O B-system  
D3,357,No useful Nmap results will be available since the target will respond to the spoofed IP and Nmap will not see those responses,O O B-tool O O O O O O B-system O O O O B-vulnerability B-feature O B-tool O O O O B-feature
D3,358,IDS alarms at the target will blame the spoofed source for the scan,B-tool B-function O O B-system O O O B-vulnerability O O O B-technique

D3,360,The idle scan is a clever technique that allows for spoofing the source IP address as discussed in the previous section while still obtaining accurate TCP port scan results ,O B-O I-O O O O O O O O B-vulnerability O B-system B-feature I-feature O O O O O O O O O O B-technique I-technique I-technique O 
D3,361,This is done by abusing the properties of the IP identification field as implemented by many systems ,O O O O O O O O O B-feature I-feature I-feature O O O O  B-system 
D3,362,However most Linux systems are immune to idle scan attacks,O O B-system I-system O O O B-attack I-attack I-attack
D3,363,Nmap performs reverse-DNS resolution by default against every responsive host ,B-tool O B-function I-function O O O O B-feature B-system 
D3,364,These DNS lookup probes could be detected Even something as unintrusive as a list scan -sL could be detected this way ,O B-function I-function B-technique O O B-technique O O O B-feature O O B-technique I-technique O O O B-technique O O
D3,365,The probes will come from the DNS server configured for the machine running Nmap,O B-technique O O O O B-system I-system B-function O O B-system O B-tool
D3,366,The most effective way to eliminate this risk is to specify -n to disable all reverse DNS resolution ,O O O O O O O B-feature O O O O O O O B-function I-function I-function
D3,367,You can specify one or more of those name servers to the dns-servers option of Nmap and all DNS queries will be proxied through them,O O O O O O O O B-system I-system O O B-system I-system O O B-tool O O B-function I-function O O B-system  O O
D3,368,The scanning results derived from task 1 to task 3 allows you to identify potential vulnerabilities to explore ,O B-technique O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-technique

D5,514,This behavior will allow syslogd to inter-operate with the syslog found in the standard C library ,O O O O B-data O O O O B-tool O O O B-app I-app I-app 
D5,515,At the same time syslogd listens on the standard syslog port for messages forwarded from other hosts ,O O O O B-data O O O O B-app B-feature O B-data O O O B-system 
D5,516,If this entry is missing syslogd neither can receive remote messages nor send them because the UDP port cannot be opened ,O O O O O B-data O O O B-feature B-data O O O O O B-feature I-feature O O O 
D5,517,Instead syslogd will die immediately blowing out an error message ,O B-app O O O O O O B-data I-data

D5,540,Logs are stored at /var/log/ on the Linux filesystem ,B-data O O O B-feature O O B-system B-system 
D5,541,At this location you should see multiple log files each one having a name describing what they actually store ,O O B-system O O O O O B-data I-data O O O O O O O O O O O 
D5,542,In this example you have dedicated log files for authentication purposes or for kernel related logs ,O O O O O O B-data I-data O B-technique O O O B-app O B-data 
D5,543,The folder /var/log does not contain only files but it also contain dedicated folders that vendors create when the application is installed,O B-data B-feature O O O O B-data O O O O O B-data O B-user O O O B-app O B-function
D5,544,Suppose that three machines are sending logs to the log server each machine is going to have its own own authlog kernlog or dpkglog files,O O O B-system O O B-data O O B-system I-system O B-system O O O O O O B-data B-data O B-data B-data
