 The program is most commonly used via a command-line interface (though GUI front-ends are also available),The program is most commonly used via a B-tool I-tool (though B-tool I-tool are also available)
"It is available for many different operating systems such as Linux, Free BSD, and Gentoo","It is available for many different B-system I-system such as B-system, B-system I-system, and B-system"
Nmap was developed for enterprise-scale networks and can scan through thousands of connected devices,B-tool was developed for B-system I-system I-system and can B-function through thousands of B-system I-system
"Moreover, Nmap has been increasingly used to inspect IoT security","Moreover, B-tool has been increasingly used to inspect B-technique I-technique"
Nmap provides information on every active IP so you can determine if an IP is being used by a legitimate service or an external attacker.,B-tool provides B-data on every B-feature B-feature so you can determine if an B-feature is being used by a B-feature B-app or an B-attacker I-attacker.
"Your network as a whole, including live hosts, open ports, and the OS of every connected device.","Your B-system as a whole, including B-system I-system, B-feature I-feature, and the B-system of every B-system I-system."
"Vulnerabilities, scan your own server to simulate the process that a hacker would use to attack your site.","B-vulnerability, B-function your own B-system to simulate the B-technique that a B-attacker would use to B-attack your B-system"
The primary uses of Nmap can be broken into three core processes,The primary uses of B-tool can be broken into three core B-technique
"First, the program gives you detailed information on every IP active on your networks, and each IP can then be scanned","First, the program gives you detailed B-data on every B-feature B-feature on your B-system, and each B-feature can then be B-function"
"This allows administratorsto check whether an IP is being used by a legitimate service or an external attacker.",This allows B-securityTeam to check whether an B-feature is being used by a B-feature I-feature or an B-attacker I-attacker

TCP Full Connect (Vanilla) Scan,B-technique I-technique I-technique I-technique I-technique
we assume that the scanning target’s IP address ,we assume that the B-technique B-system B-feature I-feature
TCP Connect scan completes the 3-way handshake,B-technique I-technique I-technique completes the B-technique I-technique 
"If a port is open, the operating system completed the TCP three-way handshake, and the port scanner immediately closes the connection to avoid DOS. ","If a B-feature is B-feature, the B-system I-system completed the B-feature B-technique I-technique I-technique, and the B-tool I-tool immediately closes the B-feature to avoid B-attack. "
"This is ""noisy” because the services can log the sender IP address and trigger Intrusion Detection Systems",This is B-feature because the B-feature can B-function the B-system B-feature I-feature and trigger B-tool I-tool I-tool
the Full scan has the following features,the B-technique I-technique has the following features
Attempts to completes 3-way handshake with each scanned port,Attempts to completes B-technique I-technique I-technique with each B-vulnerability B-feature
Sends SYN and waits for ACK before sending ACK,B-function B-feature and waits for B-feature before B-function B-feature
Tears down connection using FIN packets,B-feature I-feature B-feature using B-data I-data
"If target port is closed, sender will received either no response, a RESET packet , or an ICMP Port Unreachable packet.","If B-feature I-feature is B-feature, B-system will B-function either no B-feature, a B-data I-data , or an B-data I-data I-data I-data."
"Not stealthy, the connection request can be logged","Not B-vulnerability, the B-feature I-feature can be B-function"
UDP scan checks to see if any UDP ports are listening. ,B-technique I-technique checks to see if any B-feature I-feature are B-feature. 
"Since UDP does not respond with a positive acknowledgment like TCP and only responds to an incoming UDP packet when the port is closed, this type of scan can sometimes show false positives. ","Since B-feature does not B-feature with a B-feature I-feature like B-feature and only B-feature to an B-feature B-data I-data when the B-feature is B-feature, this type of B-technique can sometimes show B-feature I-feature. "
"However, it can also reveal Trojan horses running on high UDP ports and hidden RPC services.","However, it can also B-feature B-attack I-attack running on B-feature I-feature I-feature  and B-vulnerability I-vulnerability I-vulnerability."
It may be quite slow since some machines intentionally slow down responses to this kind of traffic to avoid being overwhelmed. ,It may be quite slow since some B-system intentionally B-feature I-feature I-feature to this kind of B-data to avoid being overwhelmed. 
"Machines running Windows OS, however, do not implement this slowdown feature, so you should use UDP to scan Windows hosts normally.","B-system running B-system I-system, however, do not implement this B-feature I-feature, so you should use B-feature to B-technique B-system B-system  normally."
The UDP Scan sends a UDP packet to target ports to determine if a UDP service is listening.,The B-technique I-technique sends a B-data I-data to B-feature I-feature to determine if a B-feature I-feature is B-feature.
"If the target system returns an ICMP Port Unreachable message, the target port is closed. Otherwise, the target port is assumed to be open.","If the B-system I-system returns an B-data I-data I-data I-data, the B-feature I-feature is B-feature. Otherwise, the B-feature I-feature is assumed to be B-feature."
UDP scan is unreliable since there may be false positives,B-technique I-technique is unreliable since there may be B-feature I-feature
The UDP scan can be very slow due to the following reasons,The B-technique I-technique can be very B-feature due to the following reasons
"Open and filtered ports rarely send any response, leaving Nmap to time out.","B-feature and B-feature I-feature rarely B-function any B-feature, leaving B-tool to B-feature I-feature"
"Closed ports usually send back an ICMP port unreachable error. But many hosts rate limit ICMP port unreachable messages by default (e.g., 1/sec)","B-feature I-feature usually send back an B-data I-data I-data I-data. But many B-system B-technique I-technique B-data I-data I-data I-data by B-feature (e.g., 1/sec)"
"To speed up the UDP scan Increase host parallelism, use min-hostgroup to scan multiple hosts at once","To speed up the B-technique I-technique Increase B-feature I-feature, use B-feature I-feature to B-technique multiple B-system at once"
Scan popular ports first using the -F option to scan the most common UDP ports,B-technique popular B-feature first using the -F option to B-technique the most common B-feature I-feature
Add –version-intensity 0 to version detection scans,Add B-feature I-feature 0 to B-technique I-technique B-technique
Scan from behind the firewall,B-technique from B-feature I-feature I-feature 
Use host-timeout to skip slow hosts,Use B-feature I-feature to skip B-system I-system
"Use -v (verbosity) and chill out, Nmap provides estimated time for scan completion of each host.","Use -v (B-feature) and B-feature I-feature, B-tool provides estimated time for B-technique completion of each B-system."
SYN scan is another form of TCP scanning. ,B-technique I-technique is another form of B-technique I-technique. 
"Rather than using the operating system’s network functions, the port scanner generates raw IP packets and monitors for responses. ","Rather than using the B-system I-system  B-function I-function, the B-tool I-tool generates B-data I-data I-data and B-technique for B-feature. "
This scan type is also known as “half-open scanning” because it never actually opens a full TCP connection. ,This B-technique type is also known as B-technique I-technique because it never actually B-feature a B-feature I-feature I-feature. 
The port scanner generates a SYN packet. ,The B-tool I-tool generates a B-data I-data. 
"If the target port is open, it will respond with an SYN-ACK packet","If the B-feature I-feature is B-feature, it will B-feature with an B-data I-data "
"The scanner host responds with an RST packet, closing the connection before the handshake is completed.","The B-tool B-system B-feature with an B-data I-data, B-feature the B-feature before the B-technique is completed."
"If the port is closed but unfiltered, the target will instantly respond with an RST packet. ","If the B-feature is B-feature but B-feature, the B-system will instantly B-feature with an B-data I-data. "
There is debate over which scan is less intrusive on the target host. ,There is debate over which B-technique is less B-attack on the B-system I-system
SYN scan has the advantage that the individual services never actually receive a connection.,B-technique I-technique has the advantage that the individual B-feature never actually B-function a B-feature
Only sends the initial SYN and waits for ACK to detect open port,Only sends the initial B-feature and waits for B-feature to B-technique B-feature I-feature
"SYN scans stop two-thirds of the way through the 3-way handshake, a.k.a., half-open scan","B-technique I-technique stop two-thirds of the way through the B-technique I-technique, a.k.a., B-technique  I-technique"
Attacker sends a RESET (RST) after receiving an SYN-ACK response,B-attacker sends a B-feature I-feature after B-feature an B-feature I-feature 
"A true connection is never established; thus, the target may not log the connection","A true B-feature is never B-feature; thus, the B-system may not B-function the B-feature"
Faster and stealthier than a full TCP Connect scans,Faster and B-vulnerability than a B-technique I-technique I-technique I-technique
"If the target port is closed, the destination will send a RESET or nothing","If the B-feature I-feature is B-feature, the B-system will send a B-feature or nothing"
SYN flood may cause accidental denial-of-service attacks if the target is slow,B-attack I-attack may cause B-attack B-attack I-attack if the B-system is B-feature
"FIN scan is a stealthy scan, like the SYN scan, but sends a TCP FIN packet instead. ","B-technique I-technique is a B-technique I-technique, like the B-technique I-technique, but B-function a B-data I-data I-data instead. "
"Most, but not all computers will send an RST packet back if they get this input so that the FIN scan can show false positives and negatives, but it may get under the radar of some IDS programs and other countermeasures.","Most, but not all computers will send an B-data I-data back if they get this B-feature so that the B-technique I-technique can show B-feature I-feature and B-feature, but it may get under the radar of some B-tool B-function and other countermeasures."
Ack scanning determines whether the port is filtered or not. ,B-technique I-technique determines whether the B-feature is B-feature or not. 
This is especially good when attempting to probe for the existence of a firewall and its rulesets. ,This is especially good when attempting to B-technique for the existence of a B-tool and its B-function. 
"Simple packet filtering will allow established connections (packets with the ACK bit set), whereas a more sophisticated stateful firewall might not.","Simple B-technique I-technique will allow B-feature I-feature (B-data with the I-data I-data ), whereas a more sophisticated B-feature B-tool might not."
ACK scan Sends a packet with the ACK code bit set to each target port,B-technique I-technique sends a B-data with the B-data I-data I-data I-data to each B-feature I-feature
Allows the attacker to get past some packet filtering devices,Allows the B-attacker to get past some B-technique I-technique B-system 
Allows the attacker to determine what kind of established connections a firewall or router will allow into a network by determining which ports through a firewall allow established connection responses,Allows the B-attacker to determine what kind of B-feature I-feature a B-tool or B-system will allow into a B-system by determining which B-feature through a B-tool allow B-feature I-feature B-feature
"If no response or an ICMP Port Unreachable message is returned, Nmap will label the target port as ""filtered,” meaning that a packet filter is blocking the response.","If no B-feature or an B-data I-data I-data I-data is returned, B-tool will label the B-feature I-feature as B-feature, meaning that a B-technique I-technique is B-feature the B-feature."
Another very stealthy scan that sets all the TCP header flags to off or null. ,Another very B-technique I-technique that sets all the B-feature I-feature I-feature to off or null. 
"This is not normally a valid packet, and some hosts will not know what to do with this.","This is not normally a valid B-data, and some B-system  will not know what to do with this."
"Windows operating systems are in this group, and scanning them with NULL scans will produce unreliable results. ","B-system I-system I-system are in this group, and B-technique them with B-technique I-technique will produce unreliable results. "
"However, for non-Windows servers protected by a firewall, this can be a way to get through.","However, for B-system I-system protected by a B-tool, this can be a way to get through."
"XMAS scan is similar to the NULL scan, except for all the flags in the TCP header is set to on. ","B-technique I-technique is similar to the B-technique I-technique, except for all the B-feature in the B-feature I-feature is set to on. "
Windows machines won’t respond to this due to the way their TCP stack is implemented. ,B-system I-system won’t B-feature to this due to the way their B-feature I-feature is implemented. 
"Xmas scans derive their name from the set of flags that are turned on within a packet. ",Xmas scans derive their name from the set of B-feature that are turned on within a B-data 
"These scans are designed to manipulate the PSH, URG, and FIN flags of the TCP header.","These B-technique are designed to manipulate the B-feature, B-feature, and B-feature I-feature of the B-feature I-feature."
RPC scan is special type of scan looks for machines answering to RPC (Remote Procedure Call) services. ,B-technique I-technique is special type of B-technique looks for B-system answering to B-function (B-function I-function I-function) B-apps. 
"RPC, which allows remote commands to be run on the machine under certain conditions, can be a dangerous service.","B-function, which allows B-function I-function to be run on the B-system  under certain conditions, can be a dangerous B-feature."
"Since RPC services can run on many different ports, it is hard to tell from a normal scan which ones might be running RPC. ","Since B-app I-app can run on many different B-feature, it is hard to tell from a normal B-technique which ones might be running B-function"
This scan will probe the ports found open on a machine with commands to show the program name and version if RPC is running. ,This B-technique will B-technique the B-feature found B-feature on a B-system with B-function to show the B-function B-feature and B-feature if B-function is running. 
It’s not a bad idea to run one of these scans every often to find out if and where you have these services running.,It’s not a bad idea to B-function one of these B-technique every often to find out if and where you have these B-feature B-function.
Scans RPC services using all discovered open TCP/UDP ports on the target to send RPC NULL commands. ,B-technique B-app I-app using all discovered B-feature B-feature I-feature on the B-system to send B-function I-function I-function. 
Tries to determine if an RPC program is listening at the port and identifies type of RPC program,Tries to determine if an B-function B-function is B-feature at the B-feature and identifies type of B-function B-function
IDLE scan is a super stealthy method whereby the scan packets are bounced off an external host,B-technique I-technique is a super B-technique I-technique whereby the B-technique B-data are bounced off an B-system I-system
"You don’t need to have control over the other host, but it does have to set up and meet certain requirements. ","You don’t need to have control over the other B-system, but it does have to set up and meet certain B-feature. "
"You must input the IP address of our ""zombie” host and what port number to use.",You must input the B-feature I-feature of our B-system I-system and what B-feature I-feature to use.
It is one of the more controversial options in Nmap since it really only has a use for malicious attacks.,It is one of the more controversial options in B-tool since it really only has a use for B-attack I-attack.
Probe the zombie’s IP ID and record it. Forge an SYN packet from the zombie and send it to the desired port on the target.,B-technique the B-system B-feature I-feature and record it. B-vulnerability an B-data I-data from the B-system and send it to the desired B-feature on the B-system.

One helpful feature of the TCP protocol is that systems are required by RFC 793 to send a negative response to unexpected connection requests in the form of a TCP RST (reset) packet. ,One helpful feature of the B-feature I-feature is that B-system are required by B-feature I-feature to send a B-feature I-feature to unexpected B-feature I-feature in the form of a B-data I-data I-data I-data. 
The RST packet makes closed ports easy for Nmap to recognize.,The B-data I-data makes B-feature B-feature easy for B-tool to recognize.
"Filtering devices such as firewalls, on the other hand, tend to drop packets destined for disallowed ports.","B-feature B-system such as B-tool, on the other hand, tend to drop B-data destined for disallowed B-feature"
In some cases they send ICMP error messages (usually port unreachable) instead.,In some cases they send B-data I-data I-data (usually B-feature I-feature) instead.
"Because dropped packets and ICMP errors are easily distinguishable from RST packets, Nmap can reliably detect filtered TCP ports from open or closed ones, and it does so automatically.","Because B-data I-data and B-data I-data are easily distinguishable from B-data I-data, B-tool can B-feature B-technique B-feature B-feature I-feature from B-feature or B-feature ones, and it does so automatically."

the firewall usually makes no response or send back an ICMP destination unreachable error. ,the B-tool usually makes no B-feature or send back an B-data I-data I-data I-data
This distinction allows Nmap to report whether the ACK packets are being filtered.,This distinction allows B-tool to report whether the B-data I-data are being B-feature.
The set of filtered ports reported by an Nmap ACK scan is often smaller than for an SYN scan against the same machine because ACK scans are more difficult to filter.,The set of B-feature I-feature reported by an B-tool B-technique I-technique is often smaller than for an B-technique I-technique against the same B-system because B-technique I-technique are more difficult to B-feature.

Some can only sniff the network like a normal IDS and send triggered packet responses.,Some can only B-technique the B-system like a normal B-tool and send B-feature I-feature I-feature.
The best IPS systems are inline on the network to restrict packet flow when suspicious activity is detected.,The best B-tool I-tool are inline on the B-system to restrict B-feature I-feature when B-vulnerability I-vulnerability is B-technique.
"For example, an IPS may block any further traffic from an IP address that they believe has port scanned them or attempted a buffer overflow exploit.","For example, an B-tool may B-feature any further B-data from an B-feature I-feature that they believe has B-technique I-techniqued them or attempted aB-attack I-attack I-attack."
Attackers are likely to notice this if they port scan a system and cannot connect to the reported open ports.,B-attacker are likely to notice this if they B-technique I-technique a B-system and cannot connect to the reported B-feature I-feature.
Attackers can confirm that they are blocked by trying to connect from another IP address.,B-attacker can confirm that they are B-feature by trying to connect from another B-feature I-feature

Nmap offers several timing modes that can be selected with the -T option to accomplish this. ,B-tool offers several B-feature I-feature that can be selected with the -T option to accomplish this. 
"For example, the -T paranoid option causes Nmap to send just one probe at a time, waiting five minutes between them. ","For example, the -T B-feature I-feature causes B-tool to send just one B-technique at a time, waiting five minutes between them. "
"A large scan may take weeks, but at least it probably will not be detected. ","A large B-technique may take weeks, but at least it probably will not be B-technique. "

IP fragments can be a major problem for intrusion detection systems,B-feature I-feature can be a major problem for B-tool I-tool I-tool
particularly because the handling of oddities such as overlapping fragments and fragmentation assembly timeouts are ambiguous and differ substantially between platforms. ,particularly because the handling of oddities such as B-feature I-feature and B-feature I-feature I-feature are ambiguous and differ substantially between B-system. 
"Thus, the IDS often has to guess at how the remote system will interpret a packet.","Thus, the B-tool often has to guess at how the B-system I-system will interpret a B-data"
An Nmap scan will use tiny IP fragments ,An B-tool B-technique will use B-feature I-feature I-feature
"By default, Nmap will include up to eight bytes of data in each fragment, so a typical 20 or 24 byte (depending on options) TCP packet is sent in three tiny fragments.","By default, B-tool will include up to eight B-data of B-data in each B-feature, so a typical 20 or 24 B-data (depending on options) B-data I-data is sent in three B-feature I-feature"
Every instance of -f adds eight to the maximum fragment data size. ,Every instance of -f adds eight to the maximum B-feature B-feature I-feature. 
"Fragmentation is only supported for Nmap’s raw packet features, including TCP and UDP port scans (except connect scan and FTP bounce scan) and OS detection.","B-technique is only supported for B-tool B-data I-data features, including B-feature and B-feature B-technique I-technique (except B-technique I-technique and B-technique I-technique I-technique) and B-technique I-technique."
Features such as version detection and the Nmap Scripting Engine generally don’t support fragmentation ,B-feature such as B-technique I-technique and the B-tool I-tool I-tool generally don’t support B-technique 
because they rely on your host’s TCP stack to communicate with target services.,because they rely on your B-system B-feature I-feature to communicate withB-app I-app

IDS alarms at the target will blame the spoofed source for the scan.,B-tool B-function at the B-system will blame the B-vulnerability source for the B-technique.
"This can be useful for framing innocent parties, casting doubt in the administrator’s mind about his IDS accuracy.","This can be useful for framing innocent parties, casting doubt in the B-securityTeam mind about his B-tool B-feature."

Nmap performs reverse-DNS resolution by default against every responsive host. ,B-tool performs B-function I-function by default against every B-feature B-system. 
These DNS lookup probes could be detected. Even something as unintrusive as a list scan (-sL) could be detected this way. ,These B-function I-function B-technique could be B-technique. Even something as B-feature as a B-technique I-technique (-sL) could be B-technique this way. 
The probes will come from the DNS server configured for the machine running Nmap.,The B-technique will come from the B-system I-system B-function for the B-system running B-tool.
